# IntelliScan-AI
## IntelliScan AI ðŸ©º IntelliScan AI is a powerful tool designed for the rapid medical analysis of X-ray images. Built with Python and Streamlit, this application uses a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify conditions like Covid-19 and Pneumonia. The model, constructed with Keras, achieves an impressive average accuracy of approximately 93%, providing a fast and reliable second opinion for medical professionals.  ## Model Architecture The core of the project is an 8-layer CNN that systematically processes image data to make a final prediction.  ### Model Summary Layer (type)	Output Shape	Param # conv2d (Conv2D)	(None, 222, 222, 32)	896 max_pooling2d	(None, 111, 111, 32)	0 conv2d_1 (Conv2D)	(None, 109, 109, 64)	18496 max_pooling2d_1	(None, 54, 54, 64)	0 conv2d_2 (Conv2D)	(None, 52, 52, 128)	73856 max_pooling2d_2	(None, 26, 26, 128)	0 flatten (Flatten)	(None, 86528)	0 dense (Dense)	(None, 128)	11075712  Export to Sheets ## How the Model Works The network processes an X-ray image through a series of specialized layers to understand its contents.  Convolutional & Pooling Layers act as the feature extractors. Three sets of these layers scan the image with digital filters to identify crucial patterns like edges and textures. After each scan, a pooling layer shrinks the data, forcing the model to focus only on the most significant diagnostic information.  Flatten & Dense Layers are the decision-makers. The processed image data is flattened into a single vector and fed into a fully connected (Dense) layer. This final layer analyzes all the extracted features to make an informed classification of the image.
